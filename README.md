* No need to watch ads in each videos on youku.com. Ads are crazy on that site, you have to watch an ad which can last as long as 30~60 seconds before a video starts to show.
* No need Adobe Flash. Flash player on youku.com can load a high CPU ratio.
* Easy to download. Together with DownThemAll, just need one click to download a video.
* Provide a playlist. If you do not like to download videos, just download the playlist and open it with VLC, gnome-mplayer... And if your network latency is too high to watch the video stream when using VLC, you need to adjust its connection latency: Open VLC -> Menubar -> Tools -> Preferences -> Input & codecs -> Network -> Default caching policy to "Higher latency".
* Works with Chromium and Opera. If you want to use this script on chromium/opera you need to enable javascript on youku.com.
